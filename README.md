## Flex Sensor

**Introduction:**  
Flex sensors are flexible devices that change resistance based on the amount of bending they experience. They typically consist of a layer of conductive ink deposited on a flexible substrate. As the sensor bends, the conductive particles within the ink separate, increasing the resistance along the sensor's length. This change in resistance can be measured and used to determine the degree of bending.

Flex sensors have a layer of conductive ink on one side, and as the sensor bends, the particles separate, increasing the resistance.

### DEMO

This demo shows the flex sensor bending, and the LED decreasing in brightness to increasing degrees of bend.

**Why Macros Were Not Used:**  
In the `FlexSensor.c` code, macros from the `IO_Macros.h` file were not used for interfacing the Flex Sensor due to compatibility issues or conflicts with existing code or macros. Instead, direct register manipulation and bit masking were utilized to configure pin directions and read analog values. While macros can provide abstraction and improve code readability, in this case, relying on direct register manipulation offered better compatibility with the existing codebase and avoided potential conflicts with other macros or configurations.

## Photoresistor

**Introduction:**  
Photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors (LDRs), are devices whose resistance changes in response to light intensity. They consist of a semiconductive material that becomes more conductive when exposed to light and less conductive in darkness. This change in conductivity alters the resistance of the material, which can be measured and used for various applications.

**Datasheet:**  
- [Photoresistor Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/LightImaging/SEN-09088.pdf)

Photoresistors have a semiconductive surface. Electrons start to move when light is shone on the material, changing the conductivity and then the resistance.

- Light Resistance: 8-20 k立
- Dark Resistance: 1 M立
- Cost: $1.10/unit

**Potential Applications:**
- Solar Panels
- Street Lights
- Smartphone screens

### DEMO

This demo shows the LED turning off when the photocell detects little or no light, and the LED turning on when the photocell senses ambient light.

## Installation Instructions with AVR Toolchain

To compile and upload the programs to your AVR microcontroller, you'll need to set up the AVR toolchain on your system. Follow the steps below to download and install the necessary software:

1. **Download AVRDUDE:**
   - Visit the following link: [AVR-GCC Toolchain Installation Guide](https://tinusaur.com/guides/avr-gcc-toolchain/)
   - Follow the instructions provided to download and install AVRDUDE on your system. It's recommended to use a Windows system for ease of use.

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Once the installation is complete, open your command prompt.
   - Type the following commands to check if you have installed the software correctly:
     ```
     avr-gcc -v
     avrdude -v
     avr-objcopy -V
     ```

### Compilation Process

Follow these steps to compile and upload the programs to your AVR microcontroller:

1. **Navigate to Source Code Directory:**
   - Change the directory in your command prompt to where you have downloaded the source code files.

2. **Identify COM Port:**
   - Check the COM port on which your Arduino is programmed. Make a note of this port number.

3. **Compile Source Code:**
   - Type the following command to compile the source code:
     ```
     c:\avr-gcc-11.1.0\bin\avr-gcc.exe -Os -DF_CPU=16000000UL -mmcu=atmega328p -c -o photocell.o photocell.c
     ```

4. **Link Object Files:**
   - Type the following command to link the object files:
     ```
     c:\avr-gcc-11.1.0\bin\avr-gcc.exe -mmcu=atmega328p photocell.o -o photocell
     ```

5. **Create HEX File:**
   - Type the following command to create the HEX file:
     ```
     c:\avr-gcc-11.1.0\bin\avr-objcopy.exe -O ihex -R .eeprom photocell photocell.hex
     ```

6. **Upload to Microcontroller:**
   - Type the following command to upload the HEX file to your AVR microcontroller:
     ```
     c:\avr-gcc-11.1.0\bin\avrdude.exe -patmega328p -Pcom(port#) -carduino -D -U flash:w:photocell.hex:i
     ```
   - Replace `com(port#)` with the COM port number identified in step 2.
