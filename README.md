# FlexSensor-PhotoResistor

This project interfaces both a Flex Sensor and a Photoresistor on the Arduino Uno, using C programming.

Flex sensors have a layer of conductive ink on one side, and as the sensor bends the particles separate, increasing the resistance.
- Flat Resistance = 25 kΩ
- Max Bend Resistance = 125 kΩ
- $10.80/unit

Photoresistors have a semiconductive surface. Electons start to move when light is shown on the material, changing the conductivity and then the resistance.
- Light Resistance = 8-20 kΩ
- Dark Resistance = 1 MΩ
- $1.10/unit
